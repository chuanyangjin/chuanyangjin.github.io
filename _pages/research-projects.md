**Class Embeddings Enter Class-conditional Diffusions Models**
[[Report]](https://chuanyangjin.github.io/files/Class%20Embeddings%20Enter%20Class-conditional%20Diffusion%20Models.pdf)
[[Slides]](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTvGMT2H66s4uIegT8PKpEBYM8601moDXhtDcQtAQXQdEvhVm93Urnn9DuqjzCS76JSOQI8niCH067A/pub?start=false&loop=true&delayms=3000)
[[Code]](https://github.com/chuanyangjin/DDPM-with-Class-Embeddings)

- Explore new ways to embed class-specific information into diffusion models, by generating learnable mappings from class labels with Class Embedding Networks (CENs) and concatenating them into the reverse diffusion process.
- Propose potential classes of embedding patterns such as Uniform embedding, Pyramid embedding, and Bottleneck embedding. Compare their properties through experiments and discuss the trade-offs.
