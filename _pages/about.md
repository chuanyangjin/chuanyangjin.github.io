Hello! I am a junior student in Honors Computer Science and Mathematics at NYU Courant.

My research interests lie in computer vision, generative intelligence, and multimodal learning. I am currently working with [Prof. Saining Xie](https://www.sainingxie.com/) on architectural modifications on diffusion models, and [Prof. Oded Regev](https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/) on understanding biological processes through interpretable machine learning. Before this, I worked with [Prof. Feng Chen](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/chen-feng) on self-supervised visual recognition for robots. I also spent time as a teaching assistant at NYU.

Besides academics, I enjoy roaming in movies and books. I am an avid reader of history, international relations, and scientific fiction, as well as a dedicated writer read by more than 15,000,000 times on different platforms. I also enjoy playing "Go", piano, and badminton.

Here is my [CV](https://chuanyangjin.github.io/files/Chuanyang_CV.pdf) (Last update: Jan. 2023).
